Post Views</b></p>\n\n<p>On your profile page, you can now see your total post views. This is the aggregate number of views across all of your posts (including reposts). We’re pretty hyped on this, it was tricky.</p>\n\n<p>As most of you know, our mission at Ello is to provide creators with visibility, influence, and opportunity. Our entire team is totally focused on it. We’re constantly striving towards improving your Ello experience in ways that we believe best support our mission and genuinely support creators. It’s our pleasure to go to work for you every day. </p>\n\n<p>We are working on better highlighting and communicating the value we provide creators and displaying an account’s total post views has been top of that list for a while. As it turns out, aggregating all the views and displaying them retroactively was technically rather challenging. We had this feature slotted to roll out with the redesigned profiles, but it wasn’t ready for prime time. This also meant that it took a few days for the totals to add up, but as of last Friday the counts are correct. We hope you dig seeing this.</p>\n\n<p>Total views are currently only on web and Android and are coming soon to iOS.</p>\n\n<p><b><a href=\"https://o.ello.co/http://ello.co/discover/trending\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trending</a></b></p>\n\n<p>We tweaked the <a href=\"https://o.ello.co/http://ello.co/discover/trending\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trending</a> filter to move posts through Trending faster and more accurately while better reflecting their “Trending” nature (posts that have lots of views, commentors, loves, and reposts). This tweak was predominantly focused on increasing the weight of comments from unique commenters while decrease the decay rate of Trending posts. We intend to keep iterating on Trending so expect more updates in the future.</p>"},{"kind":"image","link_url":null,"data":{"url":"https://assets1.ello.co/uploads/asset/attachment/68945/ello-optimized-e5c3ff35.jpg","alt":null},"links":{"assets":"68945"}},{"kind":"text","link_url":null,"data":"<p><b>Not For Print  Issue 02 — Resist</b></p>\n\n<p>We are excited to announce Issue 02 of Not For Print, Ello’s very own quarterly print publication designed and produced to bring heightened visibility and new opportunity to Ello’s community members.

The comment section, Loves and Reposts are all updated with a new look and feel. This work is coming ahead of a new post tool icon set that is still in development. </p>\n\n<p>But the most significant change is the addition of “Related Posts.” We are starting out simple by grabbing a random selection of posts from the same author (enough to fill a single row, depending on your device/screen size). We will be iterating on a path to more relevant related posts in the future. </p>\n\n<p>It is pretty interesting to see some of the older posts come through. During testing I saw a related post of mine that said “commenting is coming very soon.”</p>\n\n<p><b>GIF Optimization </b></p>\n\n<p>In an effort to speed up load times, we are now converting all .gifs to .mp4 (video) files. This dramatically reduces the file size and also gives us much more control over the image - for example we can now stop the animation from playing when the post is no longer on the screen. We have a few more tweaks coming to our new .gifs system (for example, we lost the ability to drag a gif to your desktop - for now) so stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p><b><a href=\"https://o.ello.co/https://ello.co/raretempodenver/post/vaf7wbw0lrblmt98kd4v6w\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rare Tempo x Ello Winners</a></b></p>\n\n<p>Congrats to the 10 winners.
