## Branching

Use the slash notation prefixed with a type followed by a topic name:

```
type/topic-name
```

Some good types to use are:

```
add/new-feature
amend/to-another-branch
epic/epic-name
fix/what-just-broke
spike/on-something-radical
refactor/that-mess
remove/the-drawer
update/existing-feature
```

It makes running `git branch` very pleasant.
