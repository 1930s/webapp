## Branching

Use the slash notation prefixed with your initials, followed by a type and a
topic name:

```
mk/type-topic-name
```

Some good types to use are:

```
mk/add-new-feature
mk/amend-to-another-branch
mk/epic-epic-name
mk/fix-what-just-broke
mk/spike-on-something-radical
mk/refactor-that-mess
mk/remove-the-drawer
mk/update-existing-feature
```

It makes running `git branch` very pleasant. Please delete your branch when you
are done with it. Stale branches will be removed violently.
