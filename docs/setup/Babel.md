# Babel

We're running our JavaScript through the [Babel transpiler][babel]. They have
some pretty good docs to get you up to speed. It's nice, trust us. Don't worry,
you can still make shit weird with JavaScript. We rock that thing experimental
style at [Strawman Stage 0](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/). Some
bleeding edge shit that will make it to browsers sometime before 2036 A.D.
